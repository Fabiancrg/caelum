## Project Description

This project implements a battery-powered environmental monitoring device using ESP32-C6/H2 with Zigbee connectivity. The device features a 3-endpoint design with remote sleep configuration, optimized for low-power operation with deep sleep support and extended wake time during network join.

This project is based on the examples provided in the ESP Zigbee SDK:

* [ESP Zigbee SDK Docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-zigbee-sdk)
* [ESP Zigbee SDK Repo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-zigbee-sdk)

## Device Features

### 🌐 Zigbee Endpoints Overview

| Endpoint | Device Type | Clusters | Description |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Environmental Sensor | Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Battery, OTA | BME280 sensor via I2C |
| **2** | Rain Gauge | Analog Input | Tipping bucket rain sensor with rainfall totals |
| **3** | Sleep Configuration | Analog Input | Remote sleep duration control (60-7200 seconds) |
| **4 (removed)** | LED Debug Control | On/Off | Moved to primary endpoint (EP1); no separate EP4 registered — LED control provided via genOnOff on EP1 |

### 💡 LED Debug Feature (Optional)

The device includes an optional WS2812 RGB LED on GPIO8 (ESP32-H2 SuperMini) that provides visual feedback:
- **Blue (Steady)**: Connected to Zigbee network

## �️ Recent changes (summary)

The following changes were applied to the firmware and Zigbee2MQTT converter in recent updates. This section documents the edits made so you can rebuild, flash and test the updated behaviour.

- Converter (`caelum-weather-station.js`):
  - Mapped the device to advertise endpoints 1..3 (removed explicit EP4 advertisement).
  - Switched configureReporting for analog inputs to numeric reporting values (example: {min:10, max:3600, change:0.1}) so controllers only subscribe to the `presentValue` attribute and not `statusFlags`.
  - Moved the On/Off expose to the primary endpoint mapping so controllers will use EP1 for LED control.

- Firmware (`main/esp_zb_weather.c`, `main/esp_zb_weather.h` and related):
  - Endpoint & cluster changes:
    - Removed Basic cluster exposure from non-primary endpoints to prevent coordinators reading Basic attributes on the sensor endpoints.
    - Moved `genOnOff` (LED debug) to the primary endpoint (EP1); no separate EP4 is registered anymore.
    - Ensured Analog Input clusters expose only `presentValue` for rain / sleep configuration to avoid sending `statusFlags` to the controller.
    - Fixed ZCL string length prefixing for `sleep_description` and other length-prefixed ZCL string attributes.

  - Rain gauge reliability and counting fixes:
    - ISR now timestamps events and queues a small event struct so the rain task can disambiguate wake-count vs queued ISR events.
    - Introduced a small duplicate-suppression window after wake (50 ms) to avoid double-counting the same physical tip when the wake path and ISR both fire for the same edge.
    - Kept the ISR handler installed across sleep/wake; bounce handling now disables/re-enables the GPIO interrupt line (gpio_intr_disable/enable) instead of removing and re-adding the ISR handler. This reduces the race window where pulses could be missed.
    - Reduced the bounce settle time and debounce defaults to improve responsiveness while still preventing false tips (defaults in code: 200 ms debounce / 200 ms settle).
    - Queue events carry ISR ticks for robust timing comparisons in the consumer task.

  - Wake/reporting timing and sleep behaviour:
    - The device now schedules a shorter reporting window after wake so overall awake time is reduced.
      - Reporting window (time between wake and starting deep-sleep preparation) is now 7 seconds (was previously 15s / 10s in some paths).
      - Per-sensor scheduled report offsets inside that window: BME280 at ~1s, rain update at ~2s, battery at ~3s, sleep-duration at ~4s.
    - Final delays in `prepare_for_deep_sleep()` were reduced (smaller vTaskDelay values) while preserving a short transmission window to allow Zigbee packets to be sent.
    - OTA behaviour is unchanged: if an OTA update is active the device will postpone deep sleep and periodically re-check the OTA status until the transfer is complete.

  - Miscellaneous:
    - `RAIN_MM_PER_PULSE` remains 0.36 mm per tip; all rain math still uses this constant.
    - NVS persistence for rain totals and sleep configuration remains in place and is used to recover counts across reboots.

## 🔁 How to build & flash the updated firmware (Windows PowerShell)

Use your existing ESP-IDF environment and the usual build/flash commands. Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Set target and open menuconfig if needed
idf.py set-target esp32h2
idf.py menuconfig

# Optional: erase flash for a clean install
idf.py -p COM3 erase-flash

# Build and flash
idf.py -p COM3 flash monitor
```

Replace `COM3` with your serial port. `monitor` attaches the serial monitor after flash; you'll see the device logs in the console.

## ✅ Test checklist after flashing

1. Pair the device with your Zigbee coordinator (or let Zigbee2MQTT re-discover the device).
2. Verify endpoints: device should advertise endpoints 1..3 and the LED On/Off should be on EP1.
3. Check Zigbee2MQTT logs: ensure that only `presentValue` for genAnalogInput is reported for rain and sleep duration, and that `statusFlags` is not being reported.
4. Trigger a rain pulse (or simulate the reed switch): verify that pulses are counted even if they occur before Zigbee reconnect; verify duplicate suppression does not double-count the same physical tip.
5. Observe a normal wake cycle: sensor reports should appear at ~1s/2s/3s/4s and the device should enter deep sleep after ~7s (log messages show the exact timing).
6. Start an OTA update (if available) and verify the device stays awake for the duration of the transfer.

If any reports are missed in practice, increase the reporting window to 10s or increase the final transmission delay in `prepare_for_deep_sleep()`.

If you'd like, I can prepare a complementary small test patch that logs timestamps when each scheduled report runs so you can measure precise timings on your hardware.


## �🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Rain Gauge Not Detecting**
- **ESP32-H2**: Verify GPIO12 connections and reed switch operation
- **ESP32-C6**: Verify GPIO5 connections and reed switch operation
- Check that device is connected to Zigbee network (rain gauge only active when connected)
- Ensure proper pull-down resistor on rain gauge input
- Both targets support rain detection during deep sleep

#### **BME280 Not Reading**  
- **ESP32-H2**: Check I2C connections (SDA: GPIO10, SCL: GPIO11)
- **ESP32-C6**: Check I2C connections (SDA: GPIO6, SCL: GPIO7)
- Verify BME280 I2C address (default: 0x76 or 0x77)
- Ensure proper power supply to sensor (3.3V)

#### **Battery Monitoring Issues**
- Verify voltage divider connections (2x 100kΩ resistors to GPIO4)
- Check battery cell voltage tap (should be 2.7V-4.2V at divider output)
- Ensure GPIO4 (ADC1_CH4) is properly configured
- Monitor serial output for ADC calibration messages
- **ESP32-H2 ADC quirk**: Uses empirical correction factor (1.604x) for DB_12 attenuation
- Battery percentage calculated from voltage (2.7V=0%, 4.2V=100%)
- **Optimized reading schedule**: 
  - First reading always happens on boot/pairing
  - Subsequent readings every hour (3600 seconds) based on elapsed time
  - Uses NVS to persist timestamp across deep sleep cycles
  - Robust to frequent wake-ups (e.g., during rain events)

#### **Zigbee Connection Issues**
- Perform factory reset with long press (5s) on built-in button
- Ensure Zigbee coordinator is in pairing mode
- Check channel compatibility between coordinator and device
- **Auto-retry**: Device automatically retries every 30 seconds when disconnected
- **Extended wake time**: Device now stays awake for 60 seconds (instead of 10s) during join attempts
- **Battery impact**: Extended connection attempts may drain battery faster
- **Join timing**: Allow full 60 seconds for device to complete Zigbee join process

#### **Device Not Waking from Sleep**
- Check battery voltage (minimum 3.0V recommended)
- Verify wake-up sources (timer, rain gauge)
- Review sleep manager logs for errors
- **Network dependency**: Device stays awake longer when not connected to network

#### **High Battery Drain**
- Check if device is stuck in connection retry mode (30-second intervals)
- Verify Zigbee network is stable and accessible
- Monitor connection retry count in device logs
- Consider factory reset if connection issues persist
- **Battery monitoring optimization**: Should consume only ~12µAh/day (hourly readings)
- **Total optimized power**: ~230µAh/day → 10.9 year battery life (2500mAh battery)
- **LED Debug**: If enabled, LED consumes ~20mA during wake cycles (can be disabled via Zigbee)

#### **LED Not Working**
- **ESP32-H2 SuperMini**: Verify GPIO8 connection to WS2812 RGB LED
- Check LED debug feature is enabled in `esp_zb_weather.h` (`DEBUG_LED_ENABLE=1`)
- Verify LED debug is enabled via Zigbee2MQTT switch (endpoint 4)
- Monitor serial output for LED initialization messages
- Ensure led_strip component (~2.0.0) is properly installed
- **LED States**: Blue=connected, Orange blink=joining, White flash=rain, Off=sleep/disabled
- See [LED_DEBUG_FEATURE.md](LED_DEBUG_FEATURE.md) for detailed troubleshooting
